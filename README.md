## Progress Tracker

**Bar shows total problems for the platform, split by difficulty. Filled = solved.**  

### HackerRank (Total Problems: 58 → Easy 40, Medium 16, Hard 2)

- Bar:  
`███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` Easy | `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` Medium | `░░` Hard  
- Legend: Easy 34 chars, Medium 14 chars, Hard 2 chars (normalized to 50 total)  
- Solved: Easy 3/40 → 3 blocks filled, Medium 0/16, Hard 0/2  

### LeetCode (Total Problems: 105 → Easy 56, Medium 38, Hard 11)

- Bar:  
`░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` Easy | `░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` Medium | `░░░░░░` Hard  
- Legend: Easy 26 chars, Medium 18 chars, Hard 6 chars (normalized to 50 total)

## Tools Used

- SQL (ANSI syntax preferred)  
- MS SQL Server for platform-aligned exercises  
- SQLite/PostgreSQL for local testing  
- Git + GitHub for version control and portfolio tracking  

---

## Practice Approach

1. Solve problems sequentially by difficulty  
2. Document each problem fully with SQL, goal, and notes  
3. Push to GitHub to maintain a **versioned public portfolio**  
4. Reflect on query performance, indexing, and execution best practices  
5. Track growth visually using progress bars and problem counts

---

## Future Enhancements

- Expand Medium and Hard difficulty coverage across both platforms  
- Include execution notes, indexing insights, or query optimizations  
- Optionally add diagrams or schema snapshots for complex queries  
- Update progress bars as problems are solved to track portfolio growth
