## SQL File Structure

Every solution file follows the same format to ensure consistency
and readability across the repository:

Problem:
Name of the exercise.

Platform:
Where the problem originated (HackerRank or LeetCode).

Difficulty:
Easy, Medium, or Hard.

Date Solved:
When the solution was completed.

Environment:
SQL dialect used (for example MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

Goal:
Short description of what the query must return.

Notes:
Optional explanation of logic, ordering of filters, or performance reasoning.

SQL:
Final working query.

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate:

- Structured SQL practice aligned with interview platforms
- Strong understanding of filtering, joins, and aggregations
- Ability to reason about query correctness
- Awareness of SQL execution behavior
- Consideration of indexing and performance

This repository intentionally focuses only on SQL exercises.
Larger analytics or data projects are maintained in separate repositories.

## Tools Used

- SQL (ANSI-style syntax where possible)
- Some problems written in MS SQL Server dialect depending on platform
- Queries may be tested locally using SQLite or PostgreSQL when needed

---

## Practice Approach

Problems are solved in increasing difficulty order to build:

1. Strong SQL fundamentals
2. Reliable query construction habits
3. Interview-ready SQL problem solving speed
4. Awareness of how query structure and indexing affect performance

New problems are added continuously as part of structured SQL practice.
